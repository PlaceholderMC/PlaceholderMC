# Prism Launcher

Prism Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that allows you to easily manage multiple installations of Minecraft at once.

We are working on a [website](prismlauncher.org) and other media, for more info we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/prismlauncher). Logo and branding are also coming soon.

## Installation

- All downloads and instructions for Prism Launcher will soon be available.
- Last build status can be found [here](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/actions).

### Development Builds

The latest development build is available [here](https://nightly.link/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/workflows/trigger_builds/develop). 
Development builds have debug information contained within the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.

The older development builds are available [here](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/actions) in case you need them for any reason. Make sure you have a GitHub account or else you wont be able to access these.

Portable builds are provided for AppImage on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
