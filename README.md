# PlaceholderMC is a custom launcher that will be the continuation of the now dead PolyMC.
#### We are working on a website and other media, for more info we have a discord server.
#### Logo and branding also coming soon...

## Installation

- All downloads and instructions for PlaceholderMC will soon be available
- Last build status: <https://github.com/PlaceholderMC/PlaceholderMC/actions>

### Development Builds

There are development builds available [here](https://github.com/PlaceholderMC/PlaceholderMC/actions). These have debug information in the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.
Portable builds are provided for AppImage on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
