# Prism Launcher

Prism Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that allows you to easily manage multiple installations of Minecraft at once.

We are working on a website and other media, for more info we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/prismlauncher). Logo and branding are also coming soon.

## Installation

- All downloads and instructions for Prism Launcher will soon be available.
- Last build status can be found [here](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/actions).

### Development Builds

There are development builds available [here](https://nightly.link/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/workflows/trigger_builds/develop). These have debug information in the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.

Portable builds are provided for AppImage on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Help & Support

- Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/prismlauncher) for now. 

## License

All launcher code is available under the GPL-3.0-only license.
